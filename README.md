<$2 per card to be purchased, with a small handful of exceptions to the $5 threshold

## Pack Composition

15 cards chosen from the singleton WUBRG + Gold + Colorless spell mix

1 Land chosen from the singleton land mix
1 conspiracy card chosen from 3 of each common, 2 of each uncommon, 1 of each rare.

## Errata

All face-down creatures that are morphed or manifested onto the battlefield have ward {2}. (Whenever a face-down creature you control becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, counter it unless that player pays {2})

When you draft a card from the following, you may reveal it. If you do, place it in front of you. For the remainder of the draft, if you would pick a card with a color identity of a placed card you have picked, you may exile that card from your pool face down underneath a placed card. When building your deck, you may change each card exiled this way into a copy of the corresponding placed card and add them to your pool, alongside the placed cards.

As a general rule, if it looks like a Phyrexian, it is a Phyrexian, even if the physical card lacks the subtype. The same applies for all thematic types in this cube, due to missing oracle text on many printings.
Lands that produce exactly two colors without any modification now function as Ravnica shocklands. More specifically, they lose the text "This enters the battlefield tapped" and gain "When this enters the battlefield, you may pay 2 life. If you don't, this enters the battlefield tapped." Lands that produce three or more colors remain unchanged.

Creatures with 0 power enter the battlefield with a defender counter. Creatures with defender counters have "You may remove a defender counter from this creature at any time. If you do, it loses this ability."

Creatures with defender are Walls in addition to their other types.
